# Royal Scripts

This official repository contains several scripts for Royal TS and Royal TSX, most likely written in either PowerShell or AppleScript. This collection consists out of scripts by the Royal Applications team or contributions from our great user-base!

## Disclaimer

Please notice that all scripts are provided without any guarantee nor are we/the authors responsible for any unintentional side-effects. Even when the authors are trying to provide you the best bug-free experience, scripts may have issues not covered within tests.

Furthermore feel free to change them to your needs, but please respect the license the scripts belong to.

## Contribution

Having any scripts to share with the community? Great! Just do it!

When *contributing new scripts*, please check following first:

- **The right place**: The repository should stay clearly structured, to provide an good overview. Each script should have their own directory, containing all relevant files like screenshots and documentation. Find the right place.
- **Permission**: Be sure you are allowed to share the script with the public. Publish it also under the same [license](https://github.com/royalapplications/scripts/blob/master/LICENSE) this repository belongs to. By comitting, you agree with this.
- **Documentation**: Your shared script contains enough documentation/instructions that other users are able to easily understand the purpose and are able to use it without a lot of hassle.
- **Stay clean**: Your code should be clean, smart and understandable as much as possible. Prevent having any magic, encrypted or obfuscated code.

When *modifying existing scripts*, please read first:

- **Credits**: Please respect previous authors and let them unchanged. If you feel you've done great enhancements to existing scripts, feel free to add yourself to the authors list.
- **Compatibility**: Do not forget about backwards-compatibility. Prevent breaking existing scripts. If you're doing changes regarding parameters, dependencies or anything other major changes, please create a new script directory or new files within the same folder.

Okay with the few points above? Just go ahead creating a pull request with your contribution. Thanks a lot! :-)
